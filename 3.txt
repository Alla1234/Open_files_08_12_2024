Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor 
to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
Python 2.0 was released in 2000. 
Python 3.0, released in 2008, 
was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. 
Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.
